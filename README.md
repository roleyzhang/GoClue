This is a Google Drive Console client written in Golang during the COVID-19 pandemic, I have to stay at home...
It is based on google drive api v3. Currently only supports running in the Linux environment, because some internal Linux commands are used.
In the future, I will try to add support for the windows, but maybe there are not many people who like console programs under the windows platform.

Install

   1. Go to https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/enable-drive-api,
